Server
======

The server component is what runs the hosted version of chatterbox.
It's under development at the moment, but it will eventually:

- Manage user accounts and authentication
- Act as a go between the irc connection and the client, allowing users to post
  messages and for messages to be processed by addons, allowing for special
  behaviors, such as embedding of images and videos.
